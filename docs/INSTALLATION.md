# Installation Guide

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12** (Python 3.13+ not yet supported)
  - **Note**: Python 3.13 is not compatible due to dependency limitations (specifically `open3d` in Depth-Anything V3)
  - See [Issue #11](https://github.com/Tok/depth-surge-3d/issues/11) for tracking Python 3.13 support
- FFmpeg
- CUDA 13.0+ (required for GPU acceleration)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, but strongly recommended for faster processing)
- Git
- curl or wget (for downloading models)

## Quick Setup (Recommended)

Clone the repository and run the setup script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tok/depth-surge-3d.git depth-surge-3d
cd depth-surge-3d
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The setup script will automatically:
- Install uv package manager (if not present, falls back to pip)
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all Python dependencies
- Download Video-Depth-Anything repository
- Download Video-Depth-Anything-Large model (~1.3GB)
- Verify system requirements

## Default And Optional uv Installs

The default environment does not install MoGe. Install the normal project
dependencies with:

```bash
uv sync
```

MoGe-2 support is optional. Its only supported uv install command is:

```bash
uv sync --extra moge2
```

For a separate pip or manual environment, `requirements-moge2.txt` records the
pinned MoGe source dependency:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-moge2.txt
```

This is a pip requirements path, not another uv command.

The MoGe source is fixed at Microsoft MoGe commit
`925b8ed835a7a9cdb7578ba15c658a0afc969030`. The selectable weights are also
resolved at immutable Hugging Face revisions:

| UI/setting | Parameters | Repository | Revision |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Small / `vits` | 35M | `Ruicheng/moge-2-vits-normal` | `679230677b4d282c6f304189a93e98e14f085902` |
| Base / `vitb` default | 104M | `Ruicheng/moge-2-vitb-normal` | `54ad3a693e61907ea4633d13dec6ee682fa09419` |
| Large / `vitl` | 326M | `Ruicheng/moge-2-vitl` | `39c4d5e957afe587e04eec59dc2bcc3be5ecd968` |

Remote resolution records the exact snapshot identity. Offline use therefore
requires the exact pinned snapshot to be present in the Hugging Face cache.
Every resolved snapshot, and every local custom model directory, must contain a
concrete `model.pt`; a missing file is an error rather than a request to select
another artifact.

MoGe inference uses float32 on CPU and float16 on CUDA. CUDA out-of-memory is
reported explicitly with the active variant, input size, precision, device,
and fixed adapter level. The application does not silently change variant,
lower resolution, switch to CPU, or choose another geometry mode. The adapter
level is fixed at `9`, appears only in run reports and fingerprints, and is not
a user setting or CLI control.

## Model Management

The project includes flexible model management:

```bash
# Download specific models
./scripts/download_models.sh large          # Large model (best quality)
./scripts/download_models.sh small          # Small model (fastest)
./scripts/download_models.sh small base     # Multiple models
./scripts/download_models.sh all            # All models

# Check model status
./scripts/download_models.sh                # Shows current status

# Models are automatically downloaded if missing
python depth_surge_3d.py input.mp4  # Auto-downloads if needed
```

**Available Models:**
- **Small** (24.8M params) - Fast processing, lower quality
- **Base** (97.5M params) - Balanced performance and quality
- **Large** (335.3M params) - Best quality (default)

## Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup or if the automatic setup fails:

### Step 1: System Dependencies

**FFmpeg** (required for video processing):
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew install ffmpeg

# Windows (with Chocolatey)
choco install ffmpeg

# Or download from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
```

**Python 3.9-3.12** (not 3.13+) and **Git**:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv git

# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew install python3 git

# Windows: Download from python.org and git-scm.com
```

### Step 2: Python Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tok/depth-surge-3d.git depth-surge-3d
cd depth-surge-3d

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Download Video-Depth-Anything

**Option A: Automatic download (recommended)**
```bash
./scripts/download_models.sh large
```

**Option B: Manual download**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DepthAnything/Video-Depth-Anything.git video_depth_anything_repo

# Create models directory
mkdir -p models/Video-Depth-Anything-Large

# Download the model (choose one):
# Large model (1.3GB) - best quality
wget https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Video-Depth-Anything-Large/resolve/main/video_depth_anything_vitl.pth \
     -O models/Video-Depth-Anything-Large/video_depth_anything_vitl.pth

# OR Base model (390MB) - balanced
mkdir -p models/Video-Depth-Anything-Base
wget https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Video-Depth-Anything-Base/resolve/main/video_depth_anything_vitb.pth \
     -O models/Video-Depth-Anything-Base/video_depth_anything_vitb.pth

# OR Small model (98MB) - fastest
mkdir -p models/Video-Depth-Anything-Small
wget https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Video-Depth-Anything-Small/resolve/main/video_depth_anything_vits.pth \
     -O models/Video-Depth-Anything-Small/video_depth_anything_vits.pth
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
# Test the installation
python depth_surge_3d.py --help

# Check model availability
python depth_surge_3d.py --model-info

# List supported resolutions
python depth_surge_3d.py --list-resolutions
```

**Troubleshooting Manual Setup:**
- If `wget` is not available, use `curl -L -o <output> <url>` instead
- On Windows, use PowerShell or download files manually from the URLs
- Ensure all dependencies are in your PATH before running

## Testing Your Installation

Run `./test.sh` to verify your installation:
- ✓ Python dependencies (PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy)
- ✓ CUDA availability and GPU detection
- ✓ Video-Depth-Anything module
- ✓ Model files
- ✓ FFmpeg

For developers: Run `./scripts/run-unit-tests.sh` for full test suite (770+ tests)

## Advanced: Python 3.13+ Support

**Status**: Python 3.13 is not officially supported yet, but advanced users can compile dependencies from source.

**Why the limitation?** The `open3d` library (dependency of Depth-Anything V3) doesn't provide pre-built wheels for Python 3.13 yet. See [Open3D Issue #7284](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/issues/7284) and [#7318](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/issues/7318) for upstream status.

### Option 1: Wait for Official Support (Recommended)

The Open3D team is actively working on Python 3.13 wheels. For most users, **we recommend using Python 3.9-3.12** until official wheels are released.

Track progress:
- [Depth Surge 3D Issue #11](https://github.com/Tok/depth-surge-3d/issues/11)
- [Open3D Python 3.13 Support](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/issues/7284)

### Option 2: Compile Open3D from Source (Advanced)

The latest Open3D development version supports Python 3.13 when compiled from source.

**⚠️ Warning**: This is complex and time-consuming (10-30 minutes). Only attempt if you're comfortable with:
- Command-line build tools
- Debugging compilation errors
- Managing system dependencies

**System Requirements:**
- CMake >= 3.18
- C++14 compiler (GCC 5+, Clang 7+, Visual Studio 2017+, or Xcode 8+)
- Git
- Build tools (make, ninja, or MSBuild)
- Python 3.13 development headers

**Installation Steps:**

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
# Install build dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
    cmake \
    build-essential \
    git \
    python3.13-dev \
    libpython3.13-dev \
    pkg-config \
    libeigen3-dev \
    libgl1-mesa-dev \
    libgomp1

# Clone Open3D repository
git clone --recursive https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D.git
cd Open3D

# Configure and build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_PYTHON_MODULE=ON \
      -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$(which python3.13) \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      ..

# Compile (this takes 10-30 minutes)
make -j$(nproc)
make install-pip-package

# Verify installation
python3.13 -c "import open3d; print(open3d.__version__)"
```

#### macOS (with Homebrew)
```bash
# Install build dependencies
brew install cmake eigen pkg-config

# Clone and build Open3D
git clone --recursive https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D.git
cd Open3D
mkdir build && cd build

cmake -DBUILD_PYTHON_MODULE=ON \
      -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$(which python3.13) \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      ..

make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
make install-pip-package
```

#### Windows (with Visual Studio)
```powershell
# Requires Visual Studio 2017+ with C++ tools
# Install CMake from https://cmake.org/download/

# Clone Open3D
git clone --recursive https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D.git
cd Open3D
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure (adjust Python path)
cmake -DBUILD_PYTHON_MODULE=ON ^
      -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=C:\Python313\python.exe ^
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^
      -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" ^
      ..

# Build (takes 15-30 minutes)
cmake --build . --config Release --target install-pip-package
```

**After Compiling Open3D:**

Now install Depth Surge 3D normally:
```bash
# Clone Depth Surge 3D
git clone https://github.com/Tok/depth-surge-3d.git
cd depth-surge-3d

# Create virtual environment with Python 3.13
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (open3d already compiled above)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify
python depth_surge_3d.py --help
```

**Troubleshooting Compilation:**
- **CMake errors**: Ensure CMake >= 3.18 installed
- **Missing headers**: Install development packages for your Python version
- **Eigen3 errors**: Install libeigen3-dev (Ubuntu) or eigen (macOS)
- **Build failures**: Check [Open3D compilation docs](https://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/compilation.html)
- **CUDA support**: Add `-DBUILD_CUDA_MODULE=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc` to cmake

**Still having issues?** Comment on [Issue #11](https://github.com/Tok/depth-surge-3d/issues/11) with:
- Python version (`python --version`)
- OS and version
- Error messages from compilation

### Option 3: Use Docker (Alternative)

If compilation fails, consider using Docker with Python 3.12:
```bash
# Create Dockerfile with Python 3.12
FROM python:3.12-slim
# ... rest of setup
```
